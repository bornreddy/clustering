Clustering
==========
This repo contains my implementation of the K-Means Clustering algorithm. 

This program takes in an image, and clusters it based on color, outputting a visually clustered image. A next good step would be adding Euclidean distance into my custom distance function to more intelligently determine clusters. This implementation is based largely off of the material contained in the lecture notes of Andrew Ng's Machine Learning class. 

Python implementations of clustering algorithms

How to Use it
======
Clone this repo on your machine, add run `python main.py <path_to_image>`. This project works on JPG images.
